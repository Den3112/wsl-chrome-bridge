## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security issue, please do not open a public issue. Instead, report it by contacting the maintainer via GitHub profile or by opening a draft security advisory.

### Principles of this Bridge
1. **Local Only**: The bridge does not listen on external network interfaces.
2. **Transparent**: No compiled code is used; everything is audit-able.
3. **No Data Collection**: We do not collect telemetry or user data.
